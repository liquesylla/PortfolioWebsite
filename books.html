                <h1>The Marrow Thieves, by Cherie Dimaline</h1>
                <p>I read this book as a 
                   part of my grade 11 english class.
                   It started out as a mandatory reading, but within a few pages I knew this was a book I'd enjoy regardless.
                   Cherie Dimaline tells a fictional yet all-too-real tale of the plight of indigenous peoples. Her characters and their unfortunate 
                   situations mirror many that have actually happened to indigenous indviduals in Canada. The story is filled with action, suspense, heartbreak
                   and triumphs. It's a quick read on top of that - I highly recommend this one.

                <h1>Noughts and Crosses, by Malorie Blackman</h1>
                <p>I can't tell you how many years ago I'd seen this book lying aroud in my house before I decided to pick it up out of boredom. Little did I know I would be thrown
                    into a story, a world, that would make me reconsider my own. Blackman tells an epic story set in a fictional universe where darker-skinned folk have a societal 
                    and hierchical advantage over lighter skinned-folk. Her delivery is so real that you'll find yourself forgetting that this is just a story and not a historial account.
                    The story is filled with intrigue, tragedy and drama. A must read.

                <h1>We were liars, by E.Lockhart</h1>
                <p>All is not what it seems in this slowburner. I read it not long after it came out, and I can attest to why We were Liars has recieved the praise its gotten.
                    Lockhart paints an idyllic portrait of the freedom of youth, but she doesn't do so without a twist. If I keep talking I might spoil it, so if you're into
                    slowburning dramas, this has gotta be in your to-read list.
