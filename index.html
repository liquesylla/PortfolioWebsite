            Hi, Dev Degree!
            <p> I built this website to finally put the knowledge I’ve been accumulating this past month to practical use. I elaborate more about my motivation in my personal statement, so I’ll get right into introducing what you’ll see throughout my site!</p>

            <p>Books! I love a good novel or comic book, and in case any of you do too, I've included 3 of my favourite reads from the past couple of years.</p>

        <div>
            <img src = "images/nectar.png">
            <p>Some of my favourite tunes. I've got a pretty diverse music taste, so you might find yourself a new track to add to your playlist.</p>

            <img src = "images/obed/pic2.png">
            <p>A little bit of swagger. I've included a few small influencers whose styles I think are worth checking out.</p>

            <p>My screen time - I enjoy movies and tv shows during my downtime. Maybe you'll find some movie and show picks to add to your queue. </p>

        <h1>My goal for this project</h1>
        <p>was to create a fun website that gave you a small glimpse into my interests and what I enjoy. I figured my resume and the other aspects of my application only went so far in showing what I am like.
            Hopefully this is a fun and interesting way for you to come to know me a little better. Also, be sure to move your mouse around to catch some of the animations - did you notice the animation at the beginning?
