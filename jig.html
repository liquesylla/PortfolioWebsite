                from different individuals. Below, I've curated some of my favourite "style influencers". Hold onto your hats though, 'cause they fly.

            <p>He's an influencer from Switzerland. I found his page during the early stages of quarantine, and have since actually styled some of my fits based on his.</p>

            <p>My friend found his page a few weeks ago and sent it to me knowing I would dig it. And he was right. Arran's style is more high end than the others on this 
                list, and it might not be what I would wear yet, but he's definitely worth checking out.
